# Definition Syntax:

#    pattern = regex
#    retentions = timePerPoint:timeToStore, timePerPoint:timeToStore, ...
#
# Remember: To support accurate aggregation from higher to lower resolution
#           archives, the precision of a longer retention archive must be
#           cleanly divisible by precision of next lower retention archive.

#           Valid:    60s:7d,300s:30d (300/60 = 5)
